Description

    This project is a recreation the board game Connect Four and will be played via the commandline terminal.
    It will feature two game modes, PvP and PvE. The player will make the selection once they run the program.
    Once the game starts, each player will take turns dropping their token into columns 1-7.
    If a player achieves four consecutive tokens in any position, up, down, left, right, diagonal, they win
    the game.
    If the board is filled before someone wins, the game will end in a draw.
    In the event that someone tries to add their token to an already full column, their turn will be skipped.
